# Homework

1. Look at the snakes and ladders sample solution. 
2. Find out how to run the game (it should print out results to the terminal).
3. Try to draw a class diagram of this solution.
4. Try to think of at least one question you have about the solution code and bring it to class.
5. Think about the following questions and bring your answers for tomorrow's homework review.

### Questions to consider: 

- What is different from the way you tried to solve the problem?
- Are there any parts you don't understand?
- Testing - why has the dice class not been tested?
- Why is all of the 'puts'-ing in one viewer class?
